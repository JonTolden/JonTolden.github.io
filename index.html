  <h2>About</h2>
  <p>This site is my personal and professional space to reflect on where I've been, what I've built, and where I'm going. From military operations to UAV power systems, it's a place to share the projects that matter to me and the skills I've developed along the way. It's also a way to connect with others who are passionate about solving complex problems with elegant engineering.</p>
  <h2>My Story</h2>
  <p>My journey began in the military, where I served as an MQ-1C Gray Eagle operator. I wasn't just flying drones; I was part of a team where mission success depended on trust, timing, and technology working in harmony. During that time, I worked alongside engineers who spoke the language of circuits and systems. I found myself wanting to understand the "why" behind the machines we relied on.</p>

  <p>Leaving the military and stepping into engineering school was a challenge. I went from deployment zones to classrooms, trading a uniform for textbooks and lab equipment. It was unfamiliar territory, but every circuit I wired and every system I modeled gave me a stronger sense of direction. Engineering became more than a career choice. It became a way to grow, to solve meaningful problems, and to continue serving-just in a different way.</p>
  <p>Today, I approach every project with the same mindset I carried in the military: be precise, stay reliable, and keep improving. Whether I am working on UAV power systems, embedded controls, or high-voltage electric vehicle motors, I carry a deep respect for the impact engineering can make in the real world. My mission now is to build things that work when it matters most.</p>
